# Security
Spring Boot Security App
This is a sample application that demonstrates how to implement security features using Spring Boot 3 and Java 17. 
The application provides authentication and authorization functionality to secure your web application.

Prerequisites
Before running this application, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher is installed.
Apache Maven is installed to build and run the application.
Basic knowledge of Spring Boot and Java programming is recommended.
Getting Started
To get started with the application, follow these steps:

Clone the repository or download the source code.
shell
Copy code
$ git clone <repository_url>
Navigate to the project directory.
shell
Copy code
$ cd spring-boot-security-app
Build the application using Maven.
ruby
Copy code
$ mvn clean install
Run the application.
arduino
Copy code
$ mvn spring-boot:run
The application will start running on the default port 8080.

Usage
Once the application is running, you can access it using a web browser or API testing tool. The following endpoints are available:

api/v1/auth: This endpoint allows users to log in, register and obtain an authentication token.
api/v1/demo: The endpoint under /demo require authentication. You need to include the authentication token in the request header as Authorization: Bearer <token>.
Configuration
The application provides default security configurations, but you can customize them according to your requirements. The main security configuration file can be found at src/main/java/com/example/security/SecurityConfig.java.

You can modify the security settings, add additional authentication providers, or define access rules based on your application's needs.
